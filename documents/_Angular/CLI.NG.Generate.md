# NG Generate

[Angular - ng generate reference](https://angular.io/cli/generate)

The Angular CLI command `ng generate` is used to generate new code files for an Angular application. The `ng generate` command can create new components, services, directives, pipes, modules, classes, interfaces, enums, and guards based on Angular's best practices and conventions. Using `ng generate` can save developers time and effort by automatically generating the boilerplate code needed to create new application features.

Here's an updated table with a more detailed description of what each `ng generate` action is used for:

Here's the updated table sorted alphabetically by `ng generate` action:

##  `ng generate XXXX` 

| Action | Description |

| `module` | Generates a new NgModule. `NgModule`s are used to organize an Angular application into cohesive blocks of functionality. |
| `pipe` | Generates a new pipe. Pipes are used to transform data in an Angular application, such as formatting dates or currency values. |

##  `ng generate -Usage` 

|Action | Description |

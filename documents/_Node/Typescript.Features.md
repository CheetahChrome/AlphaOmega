| ES6+ Features                | Supports modern JavaScript features like arrow functions.| |
| Tooling Integration          | Excellent tooling for code editors and IDEs.             | |
| Enhanced Readability         | Strongly typed code can improve code readability.        | |
| Code Refactoring Support     | Helps in making code changes with confidence.            | |
| Compatibility with JavaScript| Can include JavaScript code and gradually adopt TypeScript. | |
| Community and Libraries      | A large community and rich ecosystem of libraries.       | |
| Interfaces                   | Define contract-like structures for classes and objects.  | |

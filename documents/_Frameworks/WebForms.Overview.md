### State Management
| State Management Technique | Description |
| -------------------------- | ----------- |
| ViewState | ViewState is a hidden field that is encoded and sent to the client browser along with the HTML markup. When the page is posted back to the server, the server can then decode the ViewState and restore the state of the page and its controls. |
| Control State | Control State is used to persist information that is specific to a control and cannot be turned off like ViewState. |
| Hidden Fields | Hidden Fields are used to store information on the page without displaying it to the user. |
| Cookies | Cookies store data on the client's machine which can be retrieved across multiple sessions. |
| Query Strings | Query Strings are used to store data in the URL, but are visible to the user and have size limitations. |
| Application State | Application State is a global storage mechanism accessible from all sessions, but can increase memory usage. |
| Session State | Session State is used to store data related to a user's session, and is accessible from all pages within the session. |

### Drawbacks

| Drawbacks | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| ViewState | ViewState can become large, leading to slower page loads and increased bandwidth usage. It can also pose a security risk if sensitive data is stored in it. |
| Page Lifecycle Complexity | The page lifecycle in WebForms is complex and can be difficult to understand and manage, especially for new developers. |
| Testability | WebForms applications can be difficult to unit test due to the tight coupling between the code and the page lifecycle events. |
| Limited control over HTML | WebForms controls render their own HTML, which can lead to bloated and non-semantic markup. This can make it more difficult to apply custom styles and scripts. |
| Single Form Limitation | WebForms supports only a single form per page, which can be limiting for complex applications. |
| Difficulty in integrating with modern JavaScript frameworks | WebForms was designed before the rise of modern JavaScript frameworks like Angular, React, and Vue.js. As a result, it can be difficult to integrate these frameworks into a WebForms application. |
| Less Control over State Management | While WebForms provides several state management techniques, it can be difficult to control when and how state is managed, leading to inefficiencies. |
| Less Community Support | As Microsoft has shifted focus to ASP.NET MVC and ASP.NET Core, community support and resources for WebForms have decreased. |

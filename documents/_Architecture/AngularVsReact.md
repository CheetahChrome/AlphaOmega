# Angular Verses React

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Architecture | Angular is a complete framework, meaning it comes with a lot of built-in functionality out of the box, including routing, form validation, and dependency injection. React, on the other hand, is a library that focuses on the view layer of an application and does not come with built-in functionality for other parts of the application. |
| Language | Angular is written in TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language. React is written in JavaScript, which is a dynamic language that does not have static typing. |
| Templating | Angular uses HTML templates to define the user interface of an application, which are then compiled into JavaScript code at runtime. React uses JSX, which allows developers to write HTML-like code directly in their JavaScript files. |
| State management | Angular has built-in support for managing application state using RxJS observables and a centralized store called NgRx. React relies on external libraries like Redux to manage state. |
| Learning curve | Angular has a steeper learning curve due to its larger feature set and the use of TypeScript. React has a simpler API and can be easier to learn, especially for developers already familiar with JavaScript. |

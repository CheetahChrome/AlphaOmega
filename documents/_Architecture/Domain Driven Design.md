# Domain Driven Design

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a software development approach that emphasizes the importance of a deep understanding of the problem domain, its complexities, and its language. It was introduced by Eric Evans in his book "Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software" (2003). DDD focuses on collaboration between technical experts and domain experts to create a shared understanding of the domain and its business rules.

| Key Concept         | Description                                                                                                   |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Ubiquitous Language** | A common vocabulary shared by domain experts and developers, ensuring clear communication and a shared understanding of the domain. |
| **Bounded Context**     | A logical boundary that encapsulates a specific domain model, its logic, and its language, allowing for modular and maintainable development. |
| **Entities**            | Objects with a unique identity that represent important concepts in the domain.                               |
| **Value Objects**       | Immutable objects that describe attributes or properties of entities, without a unique identity.              |
| **Aggregates**          | A collection of related entities and value objects that act as a single unit, with a defined consistency boundary. |
| **Repositories**        | Abstractions for persisting and retrieving aggregates, decoupling the domain model from the underlying data storage mechanism. |
| **Domain Events**       | Notifications representing important occurrences in the domain, allowing for reactive and event-driven architectures. |
| **Domain Services**     | Stateless operations that represent domain-specific business logic that does not fit within entities or value objects. |

DDD helps in building maintainable, scalable, and flexible software systems by putting the problem domain at the center of the development process.

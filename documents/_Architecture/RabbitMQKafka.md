| Message Queue | RabbitMQ is a message queue that allows applications to communicate with each other using messaging. It supports multiple messaging protocols, including AMQP, MQTT, and STOMP, and provides features like message routing, delivery acknowledgement, and queue management. |
| Distributed Streaming Platform | Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that is designed to handle large volumes of real-time data. It allows data to be published, subscribed to, and processed in real-time, and can handle both stream processing and batch processing workloads. Kafka provides features like fault tolerance, scalability, and high throughput, and can be used for a variety of use cases such as real-time analytics, log aggregation, and event processing. |

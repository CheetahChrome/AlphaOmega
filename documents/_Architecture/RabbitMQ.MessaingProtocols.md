# Messaging Protocols


| Topic | Definition | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AMQP | Advanced Message Queuing Protocol | AMQP is an open standard protocol for message-oriented middleware that allows applications to communicate with each other using messaging. It provides features like message routing, delivery acknowledgement, and queue management, and supports a wide range of messaging patterns. AMQP is designed to be **transport-agnostic** and can be used with a variety of network protocols, including TCP, SSL/TLS, and WebSockets. |
| MQTT | Message Queuing Telemetry Transport | MQTT is a lightweight messaging protocol that is designed for use in IoT (Internet of Things) applications. It uses a publish-subscribe messaging model and is optimized for use in low-bandwidth, high-latency networks. MQTT provides features like message persistence, QoS (Quality of Service) levels, and session management, and is widely used in applications like home automation, asset tracking, and remote monitoring. |
| STOMP | Simple Text Oriented Messaging Protocol | STOMP is a text-based messaging protocol that is designed to be easy to implement and use. It provides features like message headers, transaction support, and subscription management, and can be used with a variety of transport protocols including TCP, SSL/TLS, and WebSocket. STOMP is commonly used in web applications and supports a wide range of messaging patterns. |
